Add this in head tag in html:

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.16.0/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

Popper. js is a positioning engine, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element to make it possible to position it near a given reference element. 

Bootstrap uses jQuery for JavaScript plugins (like modals, tooltips, etc). However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need jQuery.

To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following <meta> tag in head tag0

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

	width=device-width ===>screen-width of the device(varies depending on device)
	initial --->initial zoom level when browser displays page for 1st time 


Containers:
	 provide the foundation of page layout
	 contains elements of site [form ,link etc]

two container classes :
	
	* .container ----> fixed width
		As you resize your browser, its width remains intact, until it passes a
		certain breakpoint (specified by us)
		at which time it will resize to the new width for that break point.
ex:

<div class="container">
  <h1>My First Bootstrap Page</h1>
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
	* .container-fluid ---> full width container
ex:		
	
<div class="container.fluid">
  <h1>My First Bootstrap Page</h1>
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>	

Grid systems enable you to create advanced layouts using rows and columns

grid system can have up to 12 columns

introduces the new mobile-first flexbox grid system that appropriately 
scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases.
you can specify how these columns scale for different viewport sizes

=========> 12

span 1	span 1	span 1	span 1	span 1	span 1	span 1	span 1	span 1	span 1	span 1	span 1

=========> 4 ,4 & 4 span

span1 span1 span1 span1	| span1 span1 span1 span1 | span1 span1 span1 span1

=========> 4 & 8 span

span1 span1 span1 span1	| span1 span1 span1 span1 span1 span1 span1 span1

=========> 6 & 6 span

span1 span1 span1 span1	span1 span1 | span1 span1 span1 span1 span1 span1


The Bootstrap 4 grid system has five classes:

.col- (extra small devices - screen width less than 576px)
.col-sm- (small devices - screen width equal to or greater than 576px)
.col-md- (medium devices - screen width equal to or greater than 768px)
.col-lg- (large devices - screen width equal to or greater than 992px)
.col-xl- (xlarge devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1200px)

Grids should be placed within a container

Rows contain one or more columns.
Columns contain the content. 

Only columns can be immediate children of rows.

More than 12 Columns per Row?
If more than 12 columns are placed in a row, the columns will wrap to a new line.
That is, columns will wrap as a group. So for example, if a row contains a col-md-10 and 
a col-md-3, the whole col-md-3 will wrap to the new line.

Less than 12 Columns per Row?


Multiple Classes
You can use multiple class sizes for a given element.
 For example, you could use class="col-sm-10 col-md-6" to specify 10 columns for 
 small viewports and 6 columns for medium and large viewports.
