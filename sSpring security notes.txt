Spring Security :

http : Include configuration related url level security. 
auto-config : Includes some basic services. It is shorthand for –
<http>
    <form-login />
    <http-basic />
    <logout />
</http>

use-expressions : It is here to use expressions to secure individual URLs.
	 	  These expressions can be e.g. hasRole([role]), hasAnyRole([role1,role2]),
		  permitAll, denyAll etc.

intercept-url : This will match the requested url pattern from request and will decide 
		what action to take based on access value.

form-login: This will come into picture when user will try to access any secured URL. 
A login page mapped to “login-page” attribute will be served for authentication check. 
It is spring security login-processing-url.

If not provided, spring will provide an inbuilt login page to user. 
It also contains attribute for default target if login success, or login failure due to 
invalid user/password match.

logout: This will help to find the next view if logout is called in application.
